# My first Python project

Hello there, how are you?

I'm glad to announce that I've created my first Python project here today!

I am not that certain of what this will become yet, so, let me at least tell you what is going to be my tech stack:

- Python
- SQLlite (native on Python), using SQLAlchemy (as ORM)
- HTML, CSS and JS (no framework)
